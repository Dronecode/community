# List of Community Consultants

The following is a list of consultants who can help you with open source
development. It's important to note that we haven't verified any of them
and that you need to do your own diligence when engaging with them.

## How to contribute

We aren't trying to run a curated list here, instead we are encouraging
everyone to self-serve, just append yourself to the bottom of the list
and make sure to follow the Community Code of Conduct.
